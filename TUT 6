2] /*In a multi-user environment, printers often use a circular queue to manage print jobs. Each print job is added to the queue, and the printer processes them in the order they arrive. Once a print job is completed, it moves out of the queue, and the next job is processed, efficiently managing the flow of print tasks. Implement the Printer Spooler system using a circular queue without using built-in queues.*/
